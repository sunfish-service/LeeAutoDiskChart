# LeeAutoDiskChart
Here is a sqlite script to create Lee Auto Disk combinations for specific powders

I'm trying to load [this product](https://leeprecision.com/pro-auto-disk.html)from LEE Precision, Inc
and I'm using data published by them to populate the chart, all copyright to them.

Also, as all reloading tool, I took no responsibilities to your blown powder or finger(s), all risk is yours, so better check before using data I provided :)
# Features:
 - All combination of disks and powder evaluated
 - Using the most similar holes from disk sets
 - Also covers who has two set of those disks
